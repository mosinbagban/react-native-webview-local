**React Native WebView local** is a modern, well-supported, and cross-platform WebView for React Native. It is intended to be a replacement for the built-in WebView (which will be [removed from core](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/pull/3)).

> I have just fork this plugin from react-native-webview 
We just swapped out the React Native WebView in our app with the version from React Native Community. The swap took less than a day, required almost no code modifications, and is faster and CSS works better. Props to everyone in the community (including those at Infinite Red) that helped get that component split out.

## Platforms Supported

- [x] iOS (WKWebView)
- [x] Android
- [ ] Windows 10 (coming soon)

_Note: React Native WebView is not currently supported by Expo unless you "eject"._

## Versioning

If you need the exact same WebView as the one from react-native, please use version **2.0.0**. Future versions will follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Getting Started

```
$ yarn add react-native-webview
$ react-native link react-native-webview
```

Read our [Getting Started Guide](./docs/Getting-Started.md) for more.

## Usage

Import the `WebView` component from `react-native-webview-local` and use it to load webpackage from local resources.

Please put the webpackage (create a folder 'web' with  'www' folder and inside 'www' folder add 'js', 'css' & 'html' files please note all js and css file should have relative path inorder to work) keep this along side with src folder.

for android if you don't want to copy manually simpley add below line of code below dependencies{...} to your app/build.gradle file 

task copyReactNativeHTML(type: Copy) {

    from '../../web/' // It’ll copy the contents of web inside 'src/main/assets'
    into 'src/main/assets'

}

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Platform } from "react-native";
import { WebView } from "react-native-webview-local";

// ...
class MyWebComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <WebView
        source={{ uri: (Platform.OS == "android" ? "file:///android_asset/www/index.html" : "./web/www/index.html") }}
        style={{ marginTop: 20 }}
        onLoadProgress={e => console.log(e.nativeEvent.progress)}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

Import the `WebView` component from `react-native-webview` and use it like so:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from "react-native-local";
import { WebView } from "react-native-webview";

// ...
class MyWebComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <WebView
        source={{ uri: "https://infinite.red/react-native" }}
        style={{ marginTop: 20 }}
        onLoadProgress={e => console.log(e.nativeEvent.progress)}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

## Migrate from React Native core WebView to React Native WebView

Simply install React Native WebView and then use it in place of the core WebView. Their APIs are currently identical, except that this package defaults `useWebKit={true}` unlike the built-in WebView.

## Troubleshooting

- If you're getting `Invariant Violation: Native component for "RNCWKWebView does not exist"` it likely means you forgot to run `react-native link` or there was some error with the linking process

### Contributor Notes

- I've removed all PropTypes for now. Instead, we'll be using Flow types. TypeScript types will be added at a later date.
- UIWebView is not tested fully and you will encounter some yellow warning boxes. Since it is deprecated, we don't intend to put a lot of time into supporting it, but feel free to submit PRs if you have a special use case. Note that you will need to specify `useWebKit={false}` to use UIWebView
- After pulling this repo and installing all dependencies, you can run flow on iOS and Android-specific files using the commands:
  - `yarn test:ios:flow` for iOS
  - `yarn test:android:flow` for Android
- If you want to add another React Native platform to this repository, you will need to create another `.flowconfig` for it. If your platform is `example`, copy the main flowconfig and rename it to `.flowconfig.example`. Then edit the config to ignore other platforms, and add `.*/*[.]example.js` to the ignore lists of the other platforms. Then add an entry to `package.json` like this:
  - `"test:example:flow": "flow check --flowconfig-name .flowconfig.example"`
- Currently you need to install React Native 0.57 to be able to test these types - `flow check` will not pass against 0.56.
